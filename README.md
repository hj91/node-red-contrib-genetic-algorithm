# node-red-contrib-genetic-algorithm

This Node-RED node simulates a basic genetic algorithm. It's designed to evolve a population of random strings towards a target string.

## Installation

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-genetic-algorithm
```

## Node Configuration

The node has the following configuration parameters:

- **Target**: The target string that the genetic algorithm will attempt to evolve towards.
- **Population Size**: The size of the population in each generation.
- **Mutation Rate**: The probability that a mutation will occur when creating a new generation.

## Output

The node outputs a message with the payload being an object containing:

- **best_individual**: The best individual string from the final generation.
- **fitness**: The fitness of the best individual string.
- **generation**: The number of generations required to reach the best individual.
- **target**: The target string used in the simulation.
- **population_size**: The size of the population used in the simulation.
- **mutation_rate**: The mutation rate used in the simulation.

## Usage

This node can be used in various domains to solve optimization and search problems. Here are some potential applications:

1. **Optimization Problems**: The node can be used to solve complex optimization problems where traditional optimization techniques might not be effective.

2. **Machine Learning**: Genetic algorithms can be used for training machine learning models, particularly neural networks. They can be used to optimize the weights of the network.

3. **Feature Selection**: In the field of machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Genetic algorithms can be used to optimize this selection.

4. **Job Scheduling**: Genetic algorithms can be used to solve complex job scheduling problems to optimize the use of resources.

5. **Other Search and Optimization Problems**: Any problem where you are searching for a good solution among a large number of possibilities could potentially be solved with this node.

## Note

Due to the stochastic (random) nature of genetic algorithms, the output of this node can change dynamically for the same input, even if the configuration values are the same. The initial population in a genetic algorithm is typically generated randomly, and the algorithm incorporates random elements in the selection, crossover, and mutation processes. These elements of randomness help the algorithm explore a broader range of potential solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
